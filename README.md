# Forecasting-Nutrition-Crises-in-South-Sudan

Machine learning models for predicting nutrition crises in South Sudan using climate, conflict, and market data.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements machine learning models to forecast nutrition crises (GAM ≥15%) in South Sudan by integrating climate, conflict, and market data. The research demonstrates both the potential and limitations of data-driven approaches for humanitarian early warning systems.

## 🎯 Research Question

"Can machine learning models using climate, conflict, and market data reliably predict nutrition crises in South Sudan counties?"

## 📊 Key Findings

### Model Performance
- **Best Model**: Random Forest
- **Recall**: 31.7% (misses 68.3% of actual crises)
- **Precision**: 59.1% 
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.705
- **Accuracy**: 69.4%

### Critical Insight
While technically feasible, current models have **limited operational utility** for humanitarian early warning due to low recall rates. The research demonstrates promise but highlights the need for additional data sources and methodological improvements.
